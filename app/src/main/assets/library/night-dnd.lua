-- night-dnd.lua — Do Not Disturb for the night: on at 11 PM, off at 7 AM. No network.
-- @desc Do Not Disturb on at 11 PM and off at 7 AM; if you turned it on yourself, it leaves it be
-- @title Night Do Not Disturb
-- @at 23:00, 07:00
-- @uses dnd
-- @option mode priority|alarms|none How quiet: your priority people and apps, alarms only, or nothing
--
-- At ON it turns Do Not Disturb on, unless it's on already: then it's yours, and it leaves it be,
-- at OFF too. At OFF it turns off only what it turned on. (Since Android 15 that's Kolahal's own
-- Do Not Disturb mode: one you turned on yourself stays on.)
-- Kolahal needs Do Not Disturb access (type `dnd access`). To change the times, change ON and OFF
-- here and its daily times (`script at night-dnd 22:30, 06:30`) to match. Run by hand, it says
-- what it will do.
