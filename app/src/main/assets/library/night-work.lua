-- night-work.lua — the work profile off for the night: paused at 11 PM, back at 7 AM. No network.

-- At ON it pauses the work profile, unless it's paused already: then you paused it, and it leaves
-- it be, at OFF too. At OFF it resumes only what it paused. Android lets only the default launcher
-- do this, and only in front: Kolahal runs it in the foreground at its times when it may set exact
-- alarms (Settings → Apps → Kolahal → Alarms & reminders). To change the times, change ON and OFF
-- here and its daily times (`script at night-work 22:30, 06:30`) to match. Run by hand, it says
-- what it will do.
